# 🚀 Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java repository! This project documents my transition from C++ to mastering Java software engineering. I focus on writing clean, scalable code and understanding the JVM architecture.

The repository is structured into learning blocks, moving from basic syntax to modular system design.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🟢 Block 1: Java Fundamentals (`basic_projects`)
*Status: Completed*
Focuses on adapting to Java syntax, memory management, and control flow logic.

- **📂 src/basic_projects**
    - `Calculator.java`: Basic arithmetic operations using `switch-case`.
    - `CalculateDays.java`: Logic to determine days in a month (Algorithm practice).
    - `PINchecker.java`: Security simulation using `do-while` loops and validation logic.
    - `Roots.java`: Mathematical computations (Quadratic equations/Math class usage).
    - `StudentCard.java`: Input/Output operations and string formatting (`printf`).

### 🟡 Block 2: Modular Architecture (`modular_projects`)
*Status: In Progress*
Focuses on refactoring "spaghetti code" into reusable methods and handling data flow between functions.

- **📂 src/modular_projects**
    - `ModularATM.java`: A banking simulation refactored with specific methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `showBalance`).
        - *Key Concepts:* Pass-by-Value, Return types, and Method separation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java (JDK 21)
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Paradigm:** Structural Programming (Currently), shifting to OOP.
